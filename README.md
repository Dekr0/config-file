# Network Configuration

- Use `iwd` (mainly) or other alternatives like `wpa_supplicant`
  - For `iwd`, check out [iwd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Iwd#iwctl)
    - If `iwctl` cannot scan the desired network (for instance, UofA WIFI: `ResNet`, `UWS` and `ResNet_Guest`)
    - use phone to a hotspot, connect Archlinux device to the hotspot, and scan for the desired network again
